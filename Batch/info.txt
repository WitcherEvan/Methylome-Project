In Batch, we hold files containing a selection of methylome sequence filenames, which are held in Data.
Each line of a Batch file has one such filename as the line's first word.
When using createPop.py, a new Batch file is made with a second word in each line seperated by a comma ','
That second word is the distance (in kilometers) from the central plant.
